## ‚ÑπÔ∏è FAQ

#### So what is this?
This is a PHP implementation of some noise you'll most probably need anyway.

#### And what is a noise?
Nowadays, you don't just write some "working" code and ship it to the crowd through packagist..

There are a couple of homeworks you must do in order to have your masterpiece acceptable by the community: code quality, tests, readme, documentation, license, logo, changelog, CI and who knows what's next.

So those homeworks I call **noise**, they sound to me like noise not in a pejoratif way, but you know, developers usually ejoying creating new code, rather than spending time fixing, testing, validating or documenting it.

#### Which kind of noise?

Currently, we support the following noise, but feel free to increase the volume:

* [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/announcements/phpunit-9.html)
* [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)
* [Psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm)
* [SonarQube](https://dev.to/jeromegamez/continuous-php-code-quality-with-sonarcloud-276i)
* [TravisCI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/php/)
* [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer#usage)
* [README](https://github.com/medunes/noise/blob/master/README.md)
* [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/medunes/noise/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [LICENSE](https://github.com/medunes/noise/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
* [LOGO](https://github.com/medunes/noise/blob/master/logo.png)
* [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/medunes/noise/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

#### How can I use this?

So myself, I use this skeleton as a basis whenever I start a new project on Github. Instead of spending "lovely" hours setting up configs, I have the template/skeleton which I can customize according to my needs.
